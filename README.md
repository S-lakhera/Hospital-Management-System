# Hospital-Management-System
This Java application implements a basic hospital management system with functionalities for patient management, appointment scheduling, electronic health records (EHR), billing and invoicing, inventory management, and staff management.

Features:

Patient Management:
Register new patients with basic information (name, date of birth, contact details).
Assign unique patient IDs.
Appointment Scheduling:
Schedule appointments for patients with doctors.
Specify appointment date, time, and doctor's name.
Electronic Health Records (EHR): 
Simulates retrieving a patient's EHR by displaying mock data.
In a real system, this would connect to a database for patient medical history.
Billing and Invoicing:
Simulates retrieving a patient's billing information by displaying mock data.
In a real system, this would connect to a billing system for accurate records.
Inventory Management:
Displays a sample inventory list with item names, quantities, reorder levels, and restocking information.
In a real system, this would connect to an inventory management system for real-time tracking.
Staff Management: 
Displays a sample staff list with names, positions, contact information, shifts, and salaries.
In a real system, this would allow for staff record management and potentially integrate with payroll systems.
Note:

This is a basic implementation to showcase the core functionalities of a hospital management system. Real-world systems would require additional features, security measures, and integration with databases and other hospital management software.
